## Vision Statement

The purpose of this app is to **centralize** most aspects of grocery shopping lists and receipts into one place, a "smart shopping list". Users will be given an easy way to know what they or their family needs during a grocery run from a collaborative and curated list. Afterwards, the receipt from their shopping run can be supplied to the app, in turn providing the user with analyses and insights into their spending habits. This will give them crucial knowledge that will help them save money in the long run.

This app is valuable to anyone who both goes out and gets groceries and/or pays for groceries. Users can easily make grocery lists with themselves, their partner/roommates, or their family and children. Then when they go to the store to get those groceries, it's easy to just pull out their phone and check off items on the list. Afterwards, the receipt can be sent to the app where it will be compared with the shopping list. This is where the consumer can easily find out their grocery and spending habits and be alerted to useful information like impulse purchases, or an increase in prices of a favourite/important food over time. Moreover, users can easily perform price matching at checkout with any items on their list, and will be prompted of a sale at stores nearby if applicable to an item.

> It should be noted that although the principle usage/idea came from grocery shopping. The app and "smart shopping list" could be adapted to other shopping varieties. E.g. hardware stores, various things from a mall, things from a specialty store, etc.

The success criteria of this app has several factors:
- How much money users save from this app's use, be it through deals, learning from analytics, and avoiding impulse purchases.
- How much time users save from having to create a shopping list and eliminating time spent thinking about what they need while they're shopping.
- How many users adopt this technology.
- Global use, where this app is a standard for grocery shopping and commerce in the modern world.

### Grocery List

**Scenario:** A user creates a shopping list, and optionally adds other users as collaborators. They all contribute items they would like purchased. Then on the day of shopping, the shopper can cross out items as they pick them up. Finally, the list can be closed once all items are picked up. 

**Goal/description:** The user adds items they'd like to purchase to a list. Many of these lists can be created. Items can  also be removed, or crossed off as the user shops. Lists are inactive/archived after the shopping run is over (all items crossed off or user says it's done). 

> Priority: **Utmost importance**

### Sub-list Management

**Scenario:** The user can group them together by category (food type like fruit, or purpose like for a recipe) to organize the list in a more coherent way.

**Goal/description:** Items on a list will be grouped one after the other and surrounded by some colour/shape with a tag name indicating what the group is called. The user can either lasso these items together or drag and drop onto one another to group items.

> Priority: **Important**

### Receipt Upload and Tracking

**Scenario:** The user has finished their shopping and needs a quick and convenient way to log all the data.

**Goal/description:** The user can take a picture (or pictures if the receipt is long, maybe even video if multiple pictures proves too time-consuming) which will match item codes on the receipt to items on the user's shopping list, and log the price of that item. 

> Priority: **Important**

### Analytics

**Scenario:** After a grocery run, the user should be able to have a electronic copy of the receipt and see how costs of individual items and grocery runs have changed over time. They can view impulse purchases here as well.

**Goal/description:** The receipt will be presented, and graphs of either whole runs or individual items can be displayed. Items that were not on the list but purchased anyway will be flagged as impulse purchases, but the user can de-flag items they know weren't really impulsive, maybe just forgotten or added last minute.

> Priority: **Important**

### Landing Page

**Scenario:** The user has to start somewhere. They open the app to this page.

**Goal/description:** This page will contain all current lists on the users account, or if none an option to start a list. Also has links to completed lists, analytics, and profile

> Priority: Moderate

### Deals and Sales

**Scenario:** Grocers can alert users of deals/sales at their location(s) when the user adds a certain item to the list.

**Goal/description:** A non-intrusive ad banner, suggestive tool-tip, or small icon, can appear to alert the user.

> Priority: Moderate

### Profile and Social

**Scenario:** The app should encourage collaboration amoung families, households, and friends.

**Goal/description:** Accounts can be created and users can be added to lists as direct collaborators or in a restricted mode where the list owner(s) can approve/deny items added by restricted users.

> Priority: Moderate

### Recipe Sharing and "add recipe to grocery list"

**Scenario:** A group of items can be shared as a recipe and subsequently be added to a shopping list if needed.

**Goal/description:** Friend users can share small lists with each other that contain a recipe. When creating or editing a grocery list, the user who received said recipe can add it as a grouped sub-list to the list. The recipe can be saved for later. The sender of the recipe can save this recipe for later sending, editing, viewing, and list-adding.

> Priority: Moderate

### Price Matching

**Scenario:** At checkout, the user can perform price matching should the store offer it.

**Goal/description:** A user can select an item and enter its price, then the app will attempt to find prices online that are lower for that item, which the user can then display at checkout. This must be local to either country or province/state, what ever store or company policy exists must not be violated or else price matching will be frustrating.

> Priority: Can wait

### Integration with E-Commerce

**Scenario:** If a user has a list of items put together, and they intend to purchase them online, they should be able to make a purchase or set up an order from the app.

**Goal/description:** A list will have an option to order online, and select a client to order from (Amazon, Superstore's website). The app will then put together an order and send the user to the appropriate "review order and pay" page. Afterwards, the receipt

## Money

### Cost

- Server space for website, hosting backend, account info and data. 
- Employees for performing SLDC. 
- Customer service/complaints/queries.
- Marketing, paying for promotions.

### Revenue

#### Advertisements

Grocers can pay for ad space promoting items or specials. These ads must appear somewhere un-intrusively. For example, we can run an ad from a grocer for a sale on Oranges when a user adds "Oranges" to their list.

#### Coupons

Stores can send our users digital coupons to encourage them to shop there. They can be sent to some inbox, either in-app or email.

#### Framework selling/licensing

The app and "smart shopping list" could be adapted and custom crafted to other stores. 

Let's say that Canadian Tire wants to revamp how users shop online (after seeing our app or having people use our app for shopping at CT). Our software has both the list and analytics, so integrate a version that we make for them with their pre-existing user accounts. Their customers can e-shop on this app/website and have the power of our "smart shopping list", while providing an easier experience for CT customers to purchase products at CT.

They can rent/license their own version from us, instead of having to build their own from the ground up.
